## Notes

* Created to provide the means to register multiple methods for the 
  window.onbeforeunload event and to call these methods before leaving a web page.
* Works in IE, Firfox and Chrome.
* Not tested in any other browsers.

This plugin is good for web apps that are AJAX-heavy.  The need for it 
arose when I needed to find a way to prevent AJAX errors from firing when 
I'm leaving a page.  First we had a method for tracking pending AJAx 
requests so I wrote a method to abort these requests, but I needed it to 
fire onbeforeunload which was already set to check for dirty forms.
